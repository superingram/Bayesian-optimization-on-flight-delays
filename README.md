# Bayesian-optimization-on-flight-delays

Bayesian optimization is a form of hyperparameter optimization that builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameter values to the objective evaluated on a validation set.  The modeling goal will be to predict if a flight departure is going to be delayed by 15 minutes based on the other attributes in our dataset. The Bayesian hyperparameter optimization will be used to identify the best parameters for the model.
